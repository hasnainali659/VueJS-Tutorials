New script path
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.4.9/dist/vue.global.js" defer></script>

Take aways:
1. The data is a keyword and will not change.
2. The return value is a dictionary object that can have any key and value like string, array, bool e.t.can
3. These keys can be used in vue controlled areas in html. Like here it is section in html. It cannot be
used anywhere else.
4. This is called interpolation and data binding.


5. The values from the vue is only available between html tags.
for e.g <p> Learn more <a href="{{ vueLink }}">about Vue</a>.</p> it will return error. 
for dynamically changing attribute value use v-bind
6. The correct way is <p> Learn more <a v-bind:href="vueLink">about Vue</a>.</p>

7. <p>{{ outputGoal() }}</p>. We can input any js code in html controlled part
in double curly braces it can be a data attribute in vue, it can be {{1+1}}, 
{{Math.random()}}, or a Vue method anything. But it should be not to complex.
