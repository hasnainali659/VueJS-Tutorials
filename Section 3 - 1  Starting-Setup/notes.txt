1. when working with vue directive like v-if, in "" we can use any
JS code, method, computed property e.t.c.
2. v-if="any js code"
3. Can add && ||. Can point towards data property, computed property.
Also add method to execute. But should return true or false value.
4. v-else can be used in html tag directly after v-if.
5. v-show hides and shows item with css. v-if completely removes it
