1. Functions are not a good solution to output some dynamic information.
2. Data, Methods and Computed.
3. Computed property will only recalculated when any dependency changes.
4. Therefore for performance computed property should be used instead of methods
to output dynamic value.
5. Use method when some value needs to be calculated again when a page reloads.
6. Mehtods used when some value needs to be calculated when some value on the page
changes or when some event occurs.

7. Methods (Use with event binding or data binding.)
8. Data Binding: Method is executed for every "re-render" cycle of the component.
9. Use for events or data that really needs to be re evaluated all the time.

10. Computed (Use with data binding not with event binding)
11. Computed properties are only re-evaluated if one of their "used values" changed.
12. Used for data that depends on other data.

13. Watchers (not directly used in template)
14. Allows you to run any code in reaction to some changed data (e.g send http request etc.)
15. Use for any non-data update you want to make.
